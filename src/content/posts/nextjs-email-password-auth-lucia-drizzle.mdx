Authentication is very important in any application. In NextJs apps,
[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) is the go-to library for authentication.
But, NextAuth have limited support for Emali/Password authentication due to its
potential [security risks](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials).
However, there are some use cases where you need to implement a simple Email
Password authentication in your NextJs app and don't want to use a third-party
service like Clerk or Auth0. In this tutorial, we will be building a simple
email password authentication system with Nextjs v14 (app router), Lucia, and
Drizzle.
