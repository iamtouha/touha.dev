While solving a [Advent of Typescript](https://typehero.dev/aot-2023) challenge,
I stumbled upon a problem where I almost solved it but I had to convert a string
constant to a number. Initially it seemed impossible to do it in TypeScript but
eventually I found a way to do it using type template literals.

### Solution

```ts
type ToNumber<T> = T extends `${infer U extends number}` ? U : never;

const input = "123" as const;
type Input = typeof input;
//    ^? type Input = "123"
type Output = ToNumber<typeof input>;
//     ^? type Output = 123
```
