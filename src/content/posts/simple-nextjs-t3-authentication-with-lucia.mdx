## Create T3 App + Lucia Authentication

Auth implementation for Nextjs is a pain. Specially Email+Password
authentication. NextAuth intentionally limeted email password functionality to-

> discourage use of passwords due to the inherent security risks associated with
> them and the additional complexity associated with supporting usernames and
> passwords.

But in some projects clients require user password authentication. Using 3rd
party auth providers are costly. Here, lucia comes to the rescure. Lucia is a
more flexible alternative to NextAuth.js. This template is a starting point for
building a Next.js app with Lucia authentication.

[Lucia](https://lucide.dev) is a server-side authentication library for
TypeScript that aims to be unintrusive, straightforward, and flexible. At its
core, it's a library for managing users and sessions, providing the building
blocks for setting up auth just how you want.

## Lucia v/s NextAuth.js (Auth.js)

Lucia is less opinionated than Next Auth. NextAuth is too rigid if you want to
customize it. Although lucia has more setup but with that comes so much more
flexibility.

## Key Features

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Signup and Login and protected app and
  api routes with Lucia auth
- **Email Verification:** User verification using email.
- **Password Reset:** Reset user passwords by emailing password reset link.
- **Lucia + Trpc:** similar to NextAuth with tRpc,access session and user from
  trpc proceedures.
