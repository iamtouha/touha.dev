## Motivation

Implementing authentication in Next.js, especially Email+Password
authentication, can be challenging. NextAuth intentionally limits email password
functionality to discourage the use of passwords due to security risks and added
complexity. However, in certain projects, clients may require user password
authentication. Lucia offers a flexible alternative to NextAuth.js, providing
more customization options without compromising on security. This template
serves as a starting point for building a Next.js app with Lucia authentication.

## Lucia vs. NextAuth.js

Lucia is less opinionated than NextAuth, offering greater flexibility for
customization. While Lucia involves more setup, it provides a higher degree of
flexibility, making it a suitable choice for projects requiring unique
authentication configurations.

## Key Features

- **Authentication:** 💼 Support for Credential and OAuth authentication.
- **Authorization:** 🔒 Easily manage public and protected routes within the
  `app directory`.
- **Email Verification:** 📧 Verify user identities through email.
- **Password Reset:** 🔑 Streamline password resets by sending email password
  reset links.
- **Lucia + tRPC:** 🔄 Similar to NextAuth with tRPC, granting access to
  sessions and user information through tRPC procedures.
- **Stripe Payment:** 💳 Setup user subscriptions seamlessly with stripe.
- **Email template with react-email:** ✉️ Craft your email templates using
  React.
- **MySQL Database:** 🛢️ Utilize a MySQL database (Planetscale) set up using
  Drizzle for enhanced performance and type safety.
- **Database Migration:** 🚀 Included migration script to extend the database
  schema according to your project needs.
