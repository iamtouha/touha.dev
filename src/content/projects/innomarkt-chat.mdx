[@innomarkt/chat-widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@innomarkt/chat-widget).
Clients need to import this package in the project and add the following code in
order to integrate the widget in their website.

```html
<chat-widget apikey="Client API Key"></chat-widget>
```

Api key is obtained from thr admin dashboard. Clients can adjust the style of
the widget according to their website theme by passing required values to theme
attribute. They can respond to messages from visitors by logging into the chat
dashboard.

Realtime communication between the client and the server is achieved using
[socket.io](https://socket.io/). The server is built using
[express](https://expressjs.com/) and [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used
as the ORM. The server is deployed to an AWS EC2 instance. Mysql Database is
hosted locally in the same instance.
